      Progressive web apps could be the next big thing for the mobile web.
      Originally proposed by Google in 2015, they have already attracted a lot
      of attention because of the relative ease of development and the almost
      instant wins for the applicationâ€™s user experience.

      A progressive web application takes advantage of the latest technologies
      to combine the best of web and mobile apps. Think of it as a website built
      using web technologies but that acts and feels like an app. Recent
      advancements in the browser and in the availability of service workers and
      in the Cache and Push APIs have enabled web developers to allow users to
      install web apps to their home screen, receive push notifications and even
      work offline.
