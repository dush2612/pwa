      <li>
        <strong>Progressive.</strong> By definition, a progressive web app must work on any device and enhance progressively, taking advantage of any features available on the user’s device and browser.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Discoverable.</strong> Because a progressive web app is a website, it should be discoverable in search engines. This is a major advantage over native applications, which still lag behind websites in searchability.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Responsive.</strong> A progressive web app’s UI must fit the device’s form factor and screen size.
      </li>


      <li>
        <strong>App-like.</strong> A progressive web app should look like a native app and be built on the application shell model, with minimal page refreshes.
      </li>


      
      <li>
        <strong>Connectivity-independent.</strong>  It should work in areas of low connectivity or offline.
      </li>

          
      <li>
        <strong>Re-engageable.</strong> Mobile app users are more likely to reuse their apps, and progressive web apps are intended to achieve the same goals through features such as push notifications.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Installable.</strong> A progressive web app can be installed on the device’s home screen, making it readily available.
      </li>


      <li>
        <strong>Fresh.</strong>  When new content is published and the user is connected to the Internet, that content should be made available in the app.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Safe.</strong>   Because a progressive web app has a more intimate user experience and because all network requests can be intercepted through service workers, it is imperative that the app be hosted over HTTPS to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.
      </li>
